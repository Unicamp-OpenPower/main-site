# Open-source projects

|Project Name| Description|
|---|---|

| Bazel | Bazel is a free software tool that allows for the automation of building and testing of software. Similar to build tools like Make, Maven, and Gradle, Bazel builds software applications from source code using a set of rules. [Click here](https://oplab9.parqtec.unicamp.br/pub/ppc64el/bazel) to access the ppc64le binaries.

<!---  *********** OLD PROJECTS ***********
| Glibc | The GNU C Library is used as the C library in the GNU system and in GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel. 
| GDB   | The GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on `inside' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.
| Go    | Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.
| LLVM  | The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. 
| Open CASCADE | A 3D modeling kernel that consists of reusable C++ object libraries that are available as Open Source.
| Computing on Linear Algebra | Blast library
| Openjdk | an open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects
Plus several individual users who are using Power for academic research (HTM) or for testing/developing code (tightvnc, qemu, JNA, etc.)
